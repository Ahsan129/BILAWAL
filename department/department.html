                Social science is a category of academic disciplines concerned with society and the relationships
                 among individuals within a society. The disciplines include, but are not limited to: anthropology,
                  archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, musicology, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, 
                  political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: Outline of social science.

                Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term "social research" has also acquired a degree of autonomy
                 as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.
